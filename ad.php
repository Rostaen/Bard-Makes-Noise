		<h1>AD</h1>
		<p>
			Anthony DeMore was the founder and lead vocalist of the hip-hop, metal band "AD". With lyrics driven by socio-politically and environmentally charged themes, the band found a new level of heaviness when David Tarica was added in 1989. With Tarica's monster guitar riffs and DeMore's potent raps, the band quickly became a Bard favorite. After graduation, the AD lineup changed and they moved to New York City securing a record deal with Rage Records. They toured all over Europe and recorded two CDâ€™s before splitting up in the late 90s.
